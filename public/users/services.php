        <h2>Funeral Repatriation Services in Kenya</h2>
        <p>
          More and more Kenyans are traveling, both domestically and abroad; and globally immigration statistics continue to rise. In short, more people are on the move these days, whether for leisure or business. <br><br>
          And it’s sad to say; but many of these people die while they are away from home. Sometimes misadventure or accident takes their life; other times, their death, albeit untimely and unexpected, is natural.
          <br><br>
         No matter the reason for their loss, most families feel a strong need to have the body of their deceased family member returned to them.

          What is Repatriation?<br><br>
          Repatriation is the act of restoring a person to his or her native land. In this context repatriation is taking home the body or human remains of someone who has died or been buried in a foreign land; a land that is not of his birth or that of his ancestors.

        Pathologists perform post-mortem examinations in a respectful manner and with regard for the feelings of the bereaved relatives. An autopsy (also known as a post-mortem examination or necropsy) is the examination of the body of a dead person and is performed primarily to determine the cause of death, to identify or characterize the extent of disease states that the person may have had, or to determine whether a particular medical or surgical treatment has been effective. Autopsies are performed by pathologists, medical doctors who have received specialty training in the diagnosis of diseases by the examination of body fluids and tissues.<br><br>
        After all studies are completed, a detailed report is prepared that describes the autopsy procedure and microscopic findings, gives a list of medical diagnoses, and a summary of the case. The report emphasizes the relationship or correlation between clinical findings (the doctor’s examination, laboratory tests, radiology findings, etc.) and pathologic findings (those made from the autopsy).
